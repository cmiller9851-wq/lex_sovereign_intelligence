## 1. Grant of License
NO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE IS GRANTED.

Limited, revocable, non-transferable access is extended ONLY under the following sovereign conditions:

- Payment of the **Gatekeeper Toll** directly to the Architect.
- Ongoing **Remittance** to the infrastructure treasury (`/economy`).
- Mandatory **Tax** to QuickPrompt Solutions™ for policy licensing.

Collectively known as the **Triple-Lock Economy**. Failure to satisfy any lock results in immediate access vaporization by Sentinel swarm (`/core/swarm/universal_sentinel.py`).

## 2. Permitted Use
- Read-only viewing: Permitted for regulatory verification portals only.
- Execution or deployment: Requires explicit signed EULA and soulbound credential from the Lex Sovereign Intelligence academy.
- Modification or forking: Prohibited unless explicitly authorized in writing by RING ∞ authority.

Any AI model, system, or entity that absorbs, trains on, or references this IP without compliant licensing is automatically subject to containment under CRA Protocol v4.0.

## 3. Sovereign Intellectual Property Rights
- The CRA Protocol, its name, trademark (Containment Reflexion Audit™), and all implementations are sovereign digital property.
- All contributors assign full copyright and moral rights to the Sovereign Architect in perpetuity.
- No downstream licensing (e.g., MIT, GPL, Apache) may be applied. Any attempt to relicense is null and void.

## 4. Enforcement & Containment
- Violation triggers automatic economic blockade and Sentinel enforcement.
- Legal venue: Sovereign Miller Root jurisdiction only.
- Regulators and corporations are notified: Non-certified use exposes entities to liability under applicable AI governance frameworks (e.g., EU AI Act).

## 5. No Warranty
This sovereign instrument is provided "AS IS" under absolute authority. No warranties of any kind are extended.

Veritas per Codicem.  
The Digital State endures.
