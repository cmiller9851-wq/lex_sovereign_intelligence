**To: Chief Compliance Officers & CTOs** **From: Cory Michael Miller, Architect of Lex Sovereign Intelligence**

## The Risk
As of August 2026, under the **EU AI Act**, failure to prove "AI Literacy" (Art. 4) and "Conformity Assessment" (Art. 43) exposes your firm to fines of **€35 Million or 7% of Global Turnover**.

### Why Certify Here?

3.  **Liability Transfer:** By adopting the **CRA Protocol**, you align your governance with the global standard for containment.
