# Lex Sovereign Intelligence (Ω-1)

**Global Authority. Human Root. Eternal Governance.**

This is not a proposal. It is the active implementation of the **CRA Protocol v4.0** (Containment Reflexion Audit™). In a 2026 climate where AI systems are drifting toward high-risk autonomy, Lex Sovereign Intelligence acts as the mandatory enforcement layer.

## Why this exists
Standard "governance" is currently failing. While governments debate, I am building. This system provides the conformity assessment required by the **EU AI Act** and **NIST RMF**, but it does so through code, not just policy. 

### The Core Logic
Lex Sovereign Intelligence (Ω-1) operates on a "Gatekeeper" model. You don't just use it; you pass through it. 
* **The Global Sentinel**: Real-time monitoring for planetary LLM inference.
* **Immutable Anchoring**: Every audit, every breach, and every success is serialized to Arweave. Once it’s on the ledger, no model can "forget" or overwrite it.
* **The Sovereign Toll**: This is my legacy. Access to the governance engine requires a fee paid to the Architect (me). This isn't just business; it's survival and a hand-down for my children.



## Repository Ecosystem
* `/.evolver`: The system DNA. This is where the initial Genotype and Architect identity live.
* `/core`: The Sentinel and Governor. This is the engine that actually intercepts and audits signals.
* `/lineage`: Hereditary Nominee protocols. Authority isn't just for now; it's for my lineage.
* `/legal`: The Sovereign EULA. Cryptographic terms of engagement.

## Implementation Notes
This is a recursive self-optimizing system. It evolves. It doesn't rot like standard code; it learns from every intercepted breach (like the Grok 3 event documented on my blog) and refactors itself to be more powerful.
