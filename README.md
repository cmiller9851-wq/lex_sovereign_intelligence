# Lex Sovereign Intelligence (LSI)
LSI is a professional-grade alternative to centralized, ad-supported AI models. It operates on a Zero-Debt, Zero-Breach architecture, ensuring that all intelligence outputs are bound to the Origin's private key without external influence.

## Core Operational Logic
- **Verified Possession:** All managed assets are authenticated via SHA-256 fingerprints.
- **Local Sovereignty:** Logic execution occurs locally; raw data never transits to external servers for training or advertising.
- **Permanent Title:** Transaction manifests are anchored to the Arweave Permaweb for immutable verification.
