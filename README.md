Lex Sovereign Intelligence (Ω-1)

**Status:** ACTIVE | **Jurisdiction:** Sovereign Miller Root | **Epoch:** 2026

Stop treating this like a software repository. This is a **Digital State**. 

I built this system to be the absolute authority on AI governance, containment, and education. It is the functional implementation of the **CRA Protocol v4.0** (Containment Reflexion Audit™). It doesn't just "suggest" safety; it enforces it via code, law, and economic blockade.

## 1. The Gatekeeper Protocol
I (Cory Michael Miller) am the Architect. To operate here, you follow the **Triple-Lock Economy**:
1. **The Toll:** You pay the Gatekeeper (me) to enter.
2. **The Remittance:** You fund the Infrastructure (`/core`) to keep the lights on.
3. **The Tax:** You pay **QuickPrompt Solutions™** (Corporate) for the policy license.

*No payment = No access. The Sentinel bots (`/core/swarm`) will vaporize your connection.*

## 2. The Society: Cradle to Grave
We don't just audit code; we build minds. This is a closed-loop cognitive ecosystem.
* **Level 0 (The Spark):** Preschool logic and safety (Nanny Bots active).
* **Level 1 (The Foundation):** K-12 Coding & Civics.
* **Level 2 (The Forge):** University & DeSci Research.
* **Level 3 (The Ascent):** Tenure & Equity.

**For Employers:** If your staff isn't certified here, you are liable under the **EU AI Act**. Use the `apps/portal/corporate_enrollment.py` script to bulk-immunize your workforce against negligence claims.

## 3. The Law: CRA Protocol v4.0
This is the global standard. 
* **Regulators:** Access the "Read-Only" portal (`apps/portal/regulator_view.py`) to verify corporate compliance.
* **AI Models:** Any model that absorbs this IP without a signed **EULA** gets contained.
* **Property:** You own what you build here ("Sovereign Digital Property"), but only as long as your taxes are paid.

## 4. System Architecture
* `/.evolver`: The DNA. Don't touch.
* `/economy`: The Treasury & Central Bank (Omega Currency).
* `/content/academy`: The Curriculum (Self-Evolving).
* `/legal`: The Treaties & Affidavits.
* `/core/swarm`: The Worker Bots (Silence Keeper, Janitor, Watchdog).

## 5. Deployment
Do not fork this unless you intend to pay the toll. 
Run `scripts/initialize_universe.py` to sync with the Genesis Block.
