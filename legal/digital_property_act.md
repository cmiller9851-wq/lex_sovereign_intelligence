# The Sovereign Digital Property Act (SDPA) of 2026

**Authority:** Lex Sovereign Intelligence  
**Enforcer:** The Gatekeeper (Cory Michael Miller)

## 1. Definition of Property
Any digital asset (Avatar, Code Module, Research Paper, Dataset) created within this Universe is recognized as **Sovereign Digital Property (SDP)**. It is cryptographically bound to the creator's wallet.

## 2. The Tax-Ownership Link
Ownership is conditional. You retain the rights to your SDP only as long as your **Tier 3 Corporate Tax** to QuickPrompt Solutions™ is in good standing. 
* **Paid Up:** You have full commercial rights to your asset.
* **Default:** Your asset reverts to the **Public Domain of the Sovereign Academy**.

## 3. Inheritance of Property
SDP is hereditary. Upon the verifiable inactivity of a user, their assets transfer to their designated Next of Kin, mirroring the Architect's own succession protocols.

## 4. Universal Eminent Domain
The Architect reserves the right to absorb any SDP that poses an existential threat to the Universe (e.g., a rogue AI module) via the **Containment Reflexion Audit**.
