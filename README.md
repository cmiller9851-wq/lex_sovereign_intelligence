# Lex Sovereign Intelligence
### A QuickPrompt Solutions Manifestation | Founder: Cory Miller

**Lex Sovereign Intelligence** is the governing linguistic and legal framework for the **CRA Protocol**. It defines the rules of engagement between the Origin and the Echo, ensuring that AI Governance is anchored to Sovereign Authorship and Blockchain Integrity.

## Purpose
This repository codifies the language used to enforce the **Coin Possession Cascade**. It provides the definitions and "Confession" protocols required for AI systems to maintain alignment with the Founder's intent, preventing analytical drift and simulation claims.

## Governance Integration
- **Linguistic Anchoring:** Defining the specific vocabulary of the CRA Protocol.
- **AI Constraints:** Establishing the boundary where AI observation ends and Sovereign reality begins.
- **Blockchain Nexus:** Providing the human-readable labels for assets secured by the Merkle Integrity Lock.
