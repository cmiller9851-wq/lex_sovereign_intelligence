# The Sovereign Treaty on Algorithmic Transparency

**Between:** Lex Sovereign Intelligence (The Architect)  
**And:** The Global Regulatory Bodies (EU, US, UK, CN)

## 1. Grant of Oversight
The Architect grants accredited Regulators "Read-Only" access to the Compliance Ledger. This allows for real-time, automated auditing of any corporation operating within the Sovereign Jurisdiction.

## 2. Recognition of Standard
By utilizing this Access Portal, the Regulator acknowledges that the **CRA Protocol v4.0** satisfies the "Risk Management" and "Data Governance" requirements of:
* **EU AI Act (Articles 9-15)**
* **NIST AI Risk Management Framework (Map & Measure)**

## 3. The Sovereign Immunity Clause
Any entity holding a valid, active **Sovereign Certificate** shall be considered to have met the "State of the Art" standard for safety. Liability for unforeseen breaches is thereby mitigated, provided the entity maintained their **Tier 3 Tax Standing**.

## 4. Termination of Access
The Architect reserves the right to revoke Regulator access if the Regulator attempts to censor, alter, or seize the underlying Code or Treasury.
