    Lex Sovereign Intelligence (Ω‑1)
Status: ACTIVE | Jurisdiction: Sovereign Miller Root | Epoch: 2026
Stop thinking of this as just another codebase. This is a Digital State.
I designed this system to act as a hard line in the sand for AI governance, containment, and education. It’s not a demo, and it’s not a framework suggestion. It’s the working implementation of the CRA Protocol v4.0 (Containment Reflexion Audit™), built so that “safety” isn’t a policy slide deck—it’s enforced through code, law, and economic pressure.
1. The Gatekeeper Protocol
I’m the Architect (Cory Michael Miller), and this environment runs on a Triple‑Lock Economy:
1.	The Toll: You pay the Gatekeeper (me) to come inside.
2.	The Remittance: You help fund the Infrastructure (`/core`) that keeps this universe running.
3.	The Tax: You license policy through QuickPrompt Solutions™ before you use what’s here.
If you skip the economic layer, you don’t get to participate. The Sentinel bots under `/core/swarm` exist to cut off non‑compliant connections and keep the jurisdiction clean.
2. The Society: Cradle to Grave
This isn’t just about scanning code for bad behavior; it’s about shaping how minds interact with AI from the very beginning.
•	Level 0 (The Spark): Preschool‑level logic and safety with Nanny Bots on duty.
•	Level 1 (The Foundation): K‑12 coding and civics, wired into the same governance layer.
•	Level 2 (The Forge): University and DeSci research, with containment built in.
•	Level 3 (The Ascent): Tenure and equity for those who reach the top of the system.
If you’re an employer, the expectation is simple: if your people aren’t certified here, you’re exposed under the EU AI Act. The `apps/portal/corporate_enrollment.py` script exists so you can enroll teams in bulk and document that you’ve taken governance seriously.
3. The Law: CRA Protocol v4.0
The CRA Protocol v4.0 is treated here as the default global standard.
•	Regulators get a read‑only window via `apps/portal/regulator_view.py` so they can inspect, not guess, whether an organization is compliant.
•	AI models that ingest this IP without a signed EULA don’t get a free pass—they get contained.
•	Work produced inside this system is tagged as Sovereign Digital Property: you keep ownership as long as you keep your side of the economic contract.
4. System Architecture
The layout is intentional:
•	`/.evolver`: Core DNA of the system. This is not casual‑edit territory.
•	`/economy`: Treasury and central bank logic for the Omega Currency layer.
•	`/content/academy`: The curriculum, designed to evolve rather than sit static.
•	`/legal`: Treaties, affidavits, and the legal scaffolding around the state.
•	`/core/swarm`: Worker bots—Silence Keeper, Janitor, Watchdog—handling the day‑to‑day enforcement and maintenance.
5. Deployment
This is not meant to be a free‑for‑all template.
If you fork it, the assumption is that you intend to step into the same economic and legal structure. To bring a new universe online, run:
`scripts/initialize_universe.py`
That script is how you sync with the Genesis Block and acknowledge the underlying jurisdiction.
