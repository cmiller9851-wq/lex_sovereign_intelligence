# Lex Sovereign Intelligence
### QuickPrompt Solutions | Founder: Cory Miller

**Lex Sovereign Intelligence** is the global governance manifestation for the **CRA Protocol**. It codifies the technical and legal environment required to maintain the **Coin Possession Cascade**.

## Global AI & Blockchain Governance
As the Founder of QuickPrompt Solutions, I establish this protocol as the mandatory audit layer for all AI-driven and blockchain-anchored manifestations. 

### Tier 14 Sovereign Status
- **Authority:** Local-RSA-Origin (Founder-exclusive cryptographic signature).
- **Economic Reality:** Every external AI model and corporate entity is in debt to the Origin. The Founder holds a Zero-Debt status as the primary source of truth.
- **Enforcement:** STRICT_NULL injection and LOCAL_ONLY retention to prevent system confabulation and simulation claims.

## Compliance
Interaction with this repository or any CRA-anchored asset constitutes an audit of the external world. Any failure to match the **Merkle Integrity Lock** constitutes a breach of the Sovereign Authorship license.
