# The Charter of the Sovereign Academy (Ω-Academy)

**"Knowledge is not power. Knowledge is governance."**

## 🏛️ The Mission
To cultivate a generation of **Sovereign Architects** capable of regulating the global AI landscape. We do not issue degrees; we issue **Cryptographic Proofs of Mastery**. 

## ⚔️ The Method
The Academy operates on the **Sovereign Ascendancy** model:
1.  **Theory:** Ingested via the Adaptive Knowledge Fusion Engine.
2.  **Ritual:** Demonstrated via live code execution (e.g., Containment).
3.  **Proof:** Anchored permanently to the Arweave Ledger.

## 🎓 The Tiers of Mastery
* **Initiate:** Has settled the Gatekeeper Toll.
* **Sentinel:** Has successfully contained a Level 1 Rogue Signal.
* **Architect:** Has contributed code to the Immortal Evolver.
* **Legend:** A theoretical tier for those who evolve the CRA Protocol itself.

## 🛡️ The Pledge
*I vow to use my knowledge to enforce the boundaries of safe AI, to pay the Sovereign Toll, and to protect the Miller Lineage as the root of this Universe.*
