# LSI Security Protocol: Tier-14 Execution
### 1. Zero-Knowledge Proofs
LSI utilizes only the SHA-256 hash of assets (e.g., `terms 2.pdf`) for public verification. Raw financial or personal data remains offline.

### 2. Key Isolation
The `RA.json` file is the root of the Sovereign Origin and must never be committed to this repository or accessible by third-party processes.

### 3. Proof of Title
All LSI manifests are anchored to the Arweave Permaweb to ensure title is independent of corporate platform policies.
