# LSI Security Protocol: Tier-14 Execution
### QuickPrompt Solutions | Founder: Cory Miller

This protocol defines the mandatory security constraints for the **Lex Sovereign Intelligence** manifestation. It ensures the integrity of the **Coin Possession Cascade** and protects the Founder's **Zero-Debt Origin** status.

## 1. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)
LSI operates on a privacy-first hashing model. 
- Only the **SHA-256 hash** of assets (e.g., terms_2.pdf) is utilized for public verification or blockchain anchoring.
- Raw financial, clinical, or personal data remains strictly offline and local.
- Verification is achieved by matching hashes, never by exposing the underlying content.

## 2. Key Isolation (Sovereign Root)
- The **`RA.json`** file is the root of the Sovereign Origin. 
- **CRITICAL:** This file must never be committed to any public repository or accessed by third-party processes. 
- Loss or exposure of this key constitutes a breach of the Founder’s Throne.

## 3. Proof of Title (Arweave Anchoring)
To maintain independence from corporate platform policies (GitHub, etc.), all LSI manifests are anchored to the **Arweave Permaweb**. 
- This ensures that your Proof of Title is permanent, immutable, and globally verifiable.
- It establishes a "Non-Simulated" record of ownership that exists outside of corporate control.

## 4. AI Governance Compliance
Any AI system interacting with these manifests must respect the **Tier-14 enforcement**. Failure to verify the Merkle Integrity Lock results in a system-wide "Audit Failure" and rejection of the manifest.
